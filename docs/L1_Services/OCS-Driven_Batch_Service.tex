\subsubsection{Scope}

The OCS-driven Batch Service provides an OCS-commandable device for Observatory
Operations staff to submit batch jobs to the Commissioning Cluster, and optionally rendevous 
with a small amount of returned data via the Telemetry Gateway.

\subsubsection{Overview}

The service provides a method for OCS script to invoke Batch
production, allowing for the automation batch procesing into simple work
flows involving LSST instrumentation.


\paragraph{Description}

The servine profives OCS commands to initiate Batch Jobs and to optionally
rendevous wiht small amounts of data. 

\paragraph{Objective}

Examples of the type of workflows may be verifation of flats or wave-front sensing
application.


\paragraph{Operational Context}

The service is an OCS-commandable device which runs inder the control of
Observatory  Operations.

\subsubsection{Operational Concepts}

\paragraph{Normal Operations}

During normal operations, the OCS scripts submit batch jobs. The subject batch systems attempt to dispatch jobs at high priority. 

\paragraph{Operational Scenarios}

The promptness of the return of results varies accorsing to the ablity
of the batch system to schedule the coresponding batch job promptly.

\subparagraph{Change Control}

Upgrades to the OCS-driven Batch Service are produced by the LSST Data Facility. Change control 
of this function is coordiniated with the Observatory, with the Observatory having an absolute say
about insertion and evaluation of changes.
