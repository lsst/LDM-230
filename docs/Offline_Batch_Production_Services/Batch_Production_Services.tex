\subsubsection{Scope}

This section describes the operational concepts for batch production services,
which are a set of services used to provide designated offline campaign
processing.

\subsubsection{Overview}

\paragraph{Description}
Batch production service operations consists of executing large or small processing
campaigns that use released software configured into pipelines to produce data products,
such as calibrations and data release products.

\paragraph{Objective}
Batch production services execute designated processing campaigns to achieve
LSST objectives. Example campaigns include calibration production, data release
production, ``after-burner'' processing to modify or add to a data release,
at-scale integration testing, producing datasets for data investigations, and
other processing as needed. Campaign processing services provide first-order QA
of data products.

\begin{itemize}

\item A campaign is a set of pipelines, a set of inputs to run the pipelines
against, and a method of handling the outputs of the pipelines.

\item A campaign satisfies a need for data products. Campaigns produce the
designated batch data products specified in the DPDD \citedsp{LSE-163}, and
other authorized data products.

\item Campaigns can be large, such as an annual release processing, or small,
such as producing a few calibrations.

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Operational Context}
Batch production services execute campaigns on computing resources to produce
the desired LSST data products, which are measured against first-level quality
criteria.

\subsubsection{Operational Concepts}
A pipeline is a body of code, typically maintained and originated within the
Science Operations group. Each pipeline is an ordered sequence of individual
steps. The output of one or more steps may be the input of a subsequent step
downstream in the pipeline. Pipelines may produce final end data products in
release processing, may produce calibrations or other data products used
internally within LSST operations, may produce data products for investigations
related to algorithm development, and may produce data products for testing
purposes that cannot be satisfied using development infrastructure.

A campaign is the set of all pipeline executions needed to achieve a LSST
objective.

\begin{itemize}

\item Each campaign has one or more pipelines.

\item Each pipeline possesses one or more configurations.

\item Each campaign has a coverage set, enumerating the distinct pipeline
invocations. There is a way to identify the input data needed for each
invocation.

\item Each campaign has an ordering constraint that specifies any dependencies
on the order of running pipelines in a campaign.

\item Each campaign has an adjustable campaign priority reflecting LSST priority
for that objective.

\item Each pipeline invocation may require one or more input pipeline data sets.

\item Each pipeline invocation produces one or more output pipeline data sets.
Notice that, for LSST, a given file may be in multiple data sets.

\item For each input pipeline data set there is a data handling scheme for
handling that data set in a
way that inputs are properly retrieved from the archive and made available for
pipeline use.

\item For each output pipeline data set there is a data handling scheme for
handling that data set in a way that outputs are properly archived.

\end{itemize}

The key factor in the nature of the LSST computing problem is the inherent
trivial parallelism due to the nature of the computations. This means that large
campaigns can be divided into ensembles of smaller, independent jobs, even
though some jobs may require a small number of nodes.

Batch Production Services are distinct from other services that may use batch
infrastructure, such as Development Support Services. Also, there are other
scenarios where pipelines need to be run outside the batch production service
environment.  For example, alternate environments include build-and-test,
capable desk-side development infrastructure, and ad-hoc running on central
development infrastructure.

From these considerations, the LSST Data Facility separates the concerns of a
reliable production service from these other use cases, which do not share the
concerns of production. This also allows for supporting infrastructure to evolve
independently. Example production service concerns include

\begin{itemize}

\item Supporting reliable operation of an ensemble of many campaigns, respecting
priorities.

\item Dealing with the problems associated with large-scale needs.

\item Dealing with the campaign documentation, presentation, curation and similar
aspects of formally produced data.

\end{itemize}

Computing resources are needed to carry out a campaign. Batch processing occurs
on LSST-dedicated computing platforms at NCSA and CC-IN2P3, and potentially on
other platforms. Resources other than for computation (i.e., CPU and local
storage), such as custodial storage to hold final data products and network
connectivity, are also needed to completely execute a pipeline and completely
realize the data handling scheme for input and output data sets.

Computing resources are physical items which are not always fit for use. They
have scheduled and unscheduled downtimes, and may have scheduled availability.
The management of campaigns, provided by the Master Batch Job Scheduling Service
requires:

\begin{enumerate}

\item the detection of unscheduled downtimes of resources

\item recovery of executing pipelines affected by unscheduled downtimes, and

\item best use of available resources.

\end{enumerate}

One class of potential resources  are opportunistic resources which may be very
capacious but not guarantee that jobs run to completion. These resources may be
needed in contingency circumstances. The Master Batch Job Scheduling Service is
capable of differentiating kills from other failures, so as to enable use of
these resources.

The types of computing platforms that may be available, with notes, are as
follows.

\begin{longtable}{|p{0.3\textwidth}|p{0.5\textwidth}|}\hline
\textbf{Platform Type} & \textbf{Notes} \\\hline
NCSA batch production computing system & Ethernet cluster with competent cluster
file system. \\\hline
NCSA L1 computing for prompt processing & Shared nothing machines, available
when not needed for observing operations. \\\hline
NCSA L3 computing & TBD \\\hline
CC-IN2P3 bulk computing & Institutional experience is shared nothing machines +
competent caches
and large volume storage. \\\hline
``Opportunistic'' HPC & LSST type jobs  running in allocated or in  backfill
context on HPC computers. [Backfill context implies jobs can be killed at
unanticipated times]. \\\hline
\end{longtable}

An Orchestration system is a system that supports the execution of a pipeline
instance. The basic functionality is as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item Pre-job context:

    \begin{itemize}

    \item Supports pre-handling of any input pipeline data sets when in-job
    context for input data is not required.

    \item Pre-stages into a platform’s storage system, if available

    \item Produces condensed versions of database tables into portable
    lightweight format (e.g., MySQL to SQLite, flat table, etc.)

    \item Deals with TBD platform-specific edge services.

    \item Identities and provides for local identity on the computing platforms.

    \item Provides  credentials and end-point information for any needed LSST
    services.

    \end{itemize}

\item In-job context:

    \begin{itemize}

    \item Provides stage-in for any in-job pipeline input data sets

    \item Provides any butler configurations necessarily provided from in-job
    context.

    \item Invokes the pipeline and collects pipeline output status and other
    operational data

    \item Provides any “pilot job” functionality.

    \item Provides stage-out for pipeline output data sets when stage-out
    requires job context.

    \end{itemize}

\item Post-job context:

    \begin{itemize}

    \item Ingests any designated data into database tables.

    \item Arranges for any post-job stage out from cluster file systems

    \item Arranges for detailed ingest into custodial data systems

    \item Transmits job status to workload management, defined below.

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

A Master Batch Job Scheduling Service:

\begin{itemize}

\item Considers the ensemble of available compute resources and the ensemble of
campaigns.

\item Dispatches pipeline invocations to an Orchestration System based on
resource availability and considering priority of campaigns.

\item Considers pipeline failures reported by the Orchestration System.

    \begin{itemize}

    \item Identifies errors indicative of a problem with computing resources,
    and arranges for incident report.

    \item Identifies some computational errors, and arranges for incident report.

    \item Retries failed pipeline invocations, if appropriate.

    \end{itemize}

\item Exposes progress of the campaign to relevant entities.

\item Provides appropriate logging and events (N.b. critical events can be
programmed to initiate an incident).

\end{itemize}

Quality support:

Operations are supported by the following concepts, defined as follows for this
document.

\begin{itemize}

\item Quality Assurance (QA) is what people do. This is identifying the issue
and arranging for fixes. One source of input is quality controls, described
below. Another source of input are the operational and scientific data products.

\item A Quality Control (QC) is a software artifact that produces some sort of
data that contains measure of quality. This data artifact may be

    \begin{itemize}

    \item Simply produced, recorded and not used, because it seems useful for
    some future, likely retrospective purpose.

    \item Displayed or presented for quality analysis.

    \item Fed as input into active quality control which is software that
    automatically affects the execution of a campaign.

    \item Fed into software that computes additional downstream quality control
    data.

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Normal Operations}

During normal operations, Batch Production Services will conduct a number of
concurrent campaigns that support LSST goals. These campaigns will be drawn from

\begin{itemize}

\item Runs to validate Data Release Processing,

\item Data Release Processing itself.

\item After-burner processing (to correct specific errors in not-yet-released
data products).

\item Calibration processing.

\item Miscellaneous processing.

\end{itemize}

While Batch Production Services will use the majority of LSST batch capability,
they may share the LSST batch infrastructure with certain Level 1 services that
require offline processing and with Level 3 batch awardees. Resource conflicts
are sorted out and expressed as priorities for each respective campaign.

The system is programmed to deal with anticipated errors. Human eye is applied
during working hours, and can be summoned when events in the underlying systems
 generate incidents.

Each campaign is monitored for technical progress, both in in the sense of
analyzing and responding to overtly flagged errors, and general monitoring and
human assessment of the overall performance of the service.

First-order Quality Assurance is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Quality controls are considered by an LSST Data Facility Production
Scientist and other staff. Data Facility staff apply any standard authorized
mitigations, such as reprocessing, flagging anomalies, etc. The Production
Scientist within the LSST Data Facility understands the full suite of quality
controls, alerts Science Operations group to anomalies, and collaborates in
diagnosis and mitigation of problems, as requested.

\item The service provided by the LSST Data Facility Production Scientist uses
operational and scientific acumen to assess the data products at a first level,
in addition to monitoring the extant quality controls. Particular attention is
paid to

    \begin{enumerate}

    \item operationally critical data (e.g., next night’s flats needed for L1
    processing)

    \item a processing campaign that is resource intensive, hence expensive to
    redo (or has expensive consequences)

    \item known problematic output data sets that are not adequately covered by
    existing quality controls.

    \item known problematic input data sets not adequately covered by existing
    quality controls.

    \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

Close collaboration is maintained between first order quality assurance and the
broader scientific quality assurance in the project. Information obtained from
first order quality assurance is continuously fed back to Science Operations.

Campaign closeout provides that all outputs are in final form, documentation and
other artifacts have been produced, and all parties are actively notified about
the status of a campaign.

\paragraph{Operational Scenarios}

\subparagraph{Initiate campaign}

Campaigns are initiated in response to an LSST objective, by specifying an
initial set of pipelines, a coverage set, and an initial priority. The Batch
Production Service is consulted with a reasonable lead time. Consistent with
LSST processes, pipelines can be modified or added (for example, in the case of
after-burners) during a campaign. These changes and additions are admitted when
the criteria of change control processes are satisfied, including

\begin{itemize}

\item relevant build-and test criteria

\item the impact of resource-intensive campaigns is approved and understood

\item production-scale test campaigns

\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Terminate failed campaign}
Reasons for a campaign failure will be documented and submitted to Science
Operations for review. Deletion of data products needs to be scheduled so that
it occurs after the review is completed. This includes backing out files, materials
from databases, and other production artifacts from the Data Backbone, and
maintaining production records as these activities occur.

\subparagraph{Pause campaign}
Stop a long running campaign from proceeding allowing for TBD interventions.

\subparagraph{Deal with problematic campaign}
LSST is a large system. Pipelines will evolve and be maintained. There will be
the campaigns, described in the operations documents. It is the nature of the
system that as issues emerge extra resources will be needed to provide focused
scrutiny on aspects of production for some pipeline. In many cases problems will
be resolved by bug fixes, or addressed by quality controls and changes to
processes. Any system needs to support mustering focused effort on quality
analysis that is urgent, and lacks an adequate basis for robust quality controls.
The LSST Data Facility Batch Production Services staff contribute effort to to solve
these problems, in collaboration with Science Operations (or other parties
responsible for codes).

\subparagraph{Deal with defective data}
Production data may be deemed defective immediately as the associated pipelines
terminate or after a period of time when inspection processes run. Such data need
to be marked such that they will not be included in release data and will be set aside
for further analysis.

\subparagraph{Deal with sudden lack (or surplus) in resources}
As noted above, for large scale computing, the amount of resource available to
support all campaigns will vary due to scheduled and unscheduled outages.

The technical system responds to an increase or decrease in resources by running
more or few jobs, once the workload manager is aware of the new level of
resources. The technical system responds to hardware failures on a running job
in just like any other system -- with the ultimate recovery being to  delete an
partial data and retry, while respecting the priorities of the respective campaigns.
